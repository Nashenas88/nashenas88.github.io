Hi, my name is Paul Faria. I've been learning about/working with
software since I was 16. I enjoy tinkering with robotics, computer
vision, and most recently, [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). I'm
using this website to see if it can help me grow as a software
engineer. I think by sharing my experiences and writing
them out, I'll be improving my communication skills and hopefully go
through some [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
Please, feel free to contact me (links in the footer) if you think
there's something I can do to improve this website, my code, or
if you just have something interesting to share.
