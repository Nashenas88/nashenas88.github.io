        Hi, my name is Paul Faria. I've been learning about/working with
        software since I was 16. I enjoy tinkering with robotics, computer
        vision, and most recently, <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I'm
        using this website to see if it can help me grow as a software
        engineer. I think by sharing my experiences and writing them out,
        I'll be improving my communication skills and hopefully go through
        some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>.
        Please, feel free to contact me (links in the menu) if you
        think there's something I can do to improve this website, my
		code, or if you just have something interesting to share.
